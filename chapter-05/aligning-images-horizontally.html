Our verdict: The 3B+ is not the fastest Single Board Computer (SBC) device available but raw speed has never been the main selling point of the Raspberry Pi, and Linux/Kodi support remains superlative and the key differentiator against other SBC’s that look attractive on paper. Overall the Raspberry Pi 3B+ provides a positive performance boost for Kodi, and we are confident the Model 3B+ will replace the outgoing 3B as the #1 popular SBC to run LibreELEC on.</p>
